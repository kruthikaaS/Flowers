Dianthus caryophyllus, commonly known as the carnation or clove pink, is a species of Dianthus. 
It is probably native to the Mediterranean region but its exact range is unknown due to extensive cultivation for the last 2,000 years.
Following on from devotion, carnations also symbolise love. Whether it's familial love, romantic love or the love of a friend, carnations will make for a lovely gift for many occasions like Mother's Day, birthday's or an anniversary.
